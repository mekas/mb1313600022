Based on my personal references that mostly into movies and TV series, I would like to create an app that gives notifications to upcoming movies and TV series since there are a lot of awaited movies and TV series with its release date. The app also shows details to upcoming movies and TV series with ratings, synopsis and trailer link to that particular movie or TV series. 

# Target Segment
+ Movies and TV shows addicts that wait their premiere release date
