# WorkSpace
Since pandemic everyone's starting to work from home, so i thought some people would get bored working from home every single day and might need new place with good ambience and wifi. I want to make an app that will display list of coffee shop that can make people more focus or get the inspirations for their work.
## Target Segment
- User who work from home
## Advance Topic
- Rest API
## Features
- List of coffee shop
- Details of the coffee shop (Operational Hour, Description, Phone, and Range price)
- Rating of the coffee shop
- Direction of the coffee shop's location
- Review of the coffee shop
## Mockups
