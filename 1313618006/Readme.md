# WorkSpace
Since pandemic everyone's starting to work from home, so i thought some people would get bored working from home every single day and might need new place with good ambience and wifi. I want to make an app that will display list of coffee shops that can make people more focus or get the inspirations for their work.
## Target Segment
- User who work from home
## Advance Topic
- Rest API
## Features
- List of coffee shops
- Details of the coffee shops (Location, Operational Hour, Description, Recommendation Menu, and Range price)
- Add favorite place
- List of favorite coffee shops
- Share the information
- Give rating to the coffee shops
