I want to create an application that can display information about Marvel's library of comic

Reason: As Far as I Know, Marvel license the information for their franchise, the publishing rights. Can you check to Marvel whether the information of its franchise free to publish. If not, Google will reject it later, when you publish the App. 

_Reply: So Marvel itself provides their official API, which can be accessed via https://developer.marvel.com/ (The Marvel Comics API) and allows developers everywhere to access information about Marvel and can use the API to develop free applications, websites, products, services, etc . I've read Marvel API terms of use and they specify the rules apply to the applications created, that there are no ads, must be offered free of charge to download or otherwise access and may not contain any in-App purchase features or any other method of monetization. So for the application that I will create will not be a problem._

I want to make music player app

Comments: Personally I don't have any problem with the idea. But are you really sure?, Rest is ideal for static data. Music if streamed online with any player typically played before waiting the data completely downloaded. With REST you need to wait until transmission is complete. This would affect user experience.
